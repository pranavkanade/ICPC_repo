The sieve of atkin is a modern algorithm for finding all prime
nos up to a specified integer. Compared with the ancient Sieve 
of Eratosthenes, which marks off multiples of primes, it does
some preliminary work and then marks off multiples of squares
of primes, that's why it has a better theoretical complexity
of (N/(log log N)).

The algorithm =>
1. Creeate a results-list, filled with 2, 3, 5
2. Create a sieve list with an entry for each positive integer;
	all entries of this list should initially be marked non prime.
3. For each entry nouber n in the sieve list, with modulo-sixty
	remainder r:
	a. if n % 12  belongs to {1, 5}
		flip the entry for each possible solution to 4x^2 + y^2 = n	   
	b. if n % 12 == 7
		flip entry for each 3x^2 + y^2 = n
	
	c. if n % 12 == 11 && x > y
		flip entry for each 3x^2 - y^2 = n

4. Start with the lowest no in the sieve list.
5. Take the next no in the sieve list still marked prime.
6. Include the no in the result list.
7. Square the no and mark all multiples of that square as non prime.
	Note that the multiples that can be factored by 2, 3, 5 need
	not be marked, as these will be ignored in the final enumaration.
8. Repeat steps four through seven.
